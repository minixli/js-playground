# js-playground

A collection of JavaScript experiments, small projects, and old-but-interesting code refactored with modern practices.  
This repository serves as a **playground** for learning, testing, and showcasing ideas in JavaScript.

## Projects

- [**async-yesno-tree**](./async-yesno-tree)  
  An **asynchronous decision tree** implementation (true/false branching).  
  Originally written 10+ years ago with classic JS style, now would be refactored with modern syntax for comparison.

- [**Classic experiments**](./experiments/classic):  
  Focused on ES3–ES5 features, legacy behavior, and core JavaScript mechanisms. Examples include:
  - Prototype inheritance patterns
  - Function context and `this` binding
  - Optional semicolons and automatic semicolon insertion
  - Unicode handling and serialization quirks

- [**Modern experiments**](./experiments/modern):  
  Focused on ES6+ features and modern JavaScript idioms. Examples include:
  - Generators and iterators

## Purpose

This repo is not about production-ready libraries, but a personal **lab notebook**.  
Each project represents a learning milestone, a coding experiment, or a implementation of something I found inspiring.
