# js-playground

A collection of JavaScript experiments, small projects, and old-but-interesting code refactored with modern practices.  
This repository serves as a **playground** for learning, testing, and showcasing ideas in JavaScript.

## Projects

- [**async-yesno-tree**](./async-yesno-tree)  
  An **asynchronous decision tree** implementation (true/false branching).  
  Originally written 10+ years ago with classic JS style, now would be refactored with modern syntax for comparison.

## Purpose

This repo is not about production-ready libraries, but a personal **lab notebook**.  
Each project represents a learning milestone, a coding experiment, or a implementation of something I found inspiring.
